Here’s a **hilariously funny `README.md`** for your VS Code extension `f-ckAI` that roasts code using AI APIs like OpenAI, Groq, and Gemini. It’s bold, sarcastic, brutally honest—and perfect for devs with a sense of humor:

# f-ckAI - A Hilarious Code Roasting Plugin

Because your code deserves to be bullied by robots.  
A VS Code extension that injects *hilarious*, *savage*, and *absolutely unnecessary* comments into your precious code using AI overlords like **OpenAI**, **Groq**, and **Gemini**.

> ❝Your code is bad, and you should feel bad.❞ — Bender, probably.

---

## 🔥 What does this do?

- Highlights your cringeworthy code
- Sends it to an AI fckrs (OpenAI/Groq/Gemini)
- Gets back a roast so savage it’ll haunt your dreams
- Inserts that roast as a code comment
- Laughs in your face

All without you having to touch StackOverflow... again.

## 💣 Features (We don't distinguish)

-  *Roast Your Code*: Highlight a chunk of your code. That’s it. The AI will do the rest.
-  *Choose Your Executioner*: Select between OpenAI, Groq, or Gemini as your designated roaster.
-  *Manage API Keys*: Because we can’t roast your code with pure vibes.
-  *Funny Comments Only*: If you’re looking for helpful feedback… this ain’t it.
-  *Support for Devs with Thick Skin*: Prepare your ego.

##  Example

Before:
```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
````

After:

```js
// Wow, Even an extra { cannot save this
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

---

##  Setup

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace (if you haven’t already).
2. Hit `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` → `fckAi: Add Funny Comments`
3. Select your favorite AI (they’re all equally judgmental).
4. Paste your API key (it’ll be stored securely... maybe).
5. Highlight the garbage—I mean, code—you want roasted.
6. Get flamed. 💀
